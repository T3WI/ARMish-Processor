# ARM-ish Processor
This project seeks to explore a subset of the ARM instruction set. The goal is to design a custom instruction set inspired by the ARM architecture, create an assembler for the instruction set, implement the architecture in hardware with an RTL model, and verify the correctness of the processor.

The assembler was implemented in Python, and the RTL model was implemented using SystemVerilog.
